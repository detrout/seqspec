# Getting started

## Initializing the spec

To help users create a seqspec from their own data, the `seqspec` cli offers a simple tool `seqspec init` that autogenerates a `spec.yaml` from a string representation of the data. The input is a [newick file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format) which naturally represents nested grouping of sequencing files and sequenced elements. By way of example, suppose we had the following sequencing data:

- `R1.fastq.gz` contains
  - 16bp barcode from a predefined "onlist"
  - 12bp umi randomly generated
- `R2.fastq.gz` contains
  - 150bp cDNA
- `I1.fastq.gz` contains
  - 8bp sample index from a predefined "onlist"

A compatible `newick` string would be

```bash
(((barcode:16,umi:12)R1.fastq.gz,(cDNA:150)R2.fastq.gz,(index7:8)I1.fastq.gz)rna)
```

Breaking the string we see the nested structure of the data

```bash
(
    (
        (
            barcode:16,
            umi:12
        )R1.fastq.gz,
        (
            cDNA:150
        )R2.fastq.gz,
        (
            index7:8
        )I1.fastq.gz
    )rna
)
```

Initializing a `seqspec` specification is as simple as

```bash
seqspec init -n myassay -m 1 -o spec.yaml "(((barcode:16,umi:12)R1.fastq.gz,(cDNA:150)R2.fastq.gz,(index7:8)I1.fastq.gz)rna)"
```

Note that the newick string must be enclosed in quotes.

## Populate the spec

Next, add relevant information to the spec by hand- add information about the assay to the spec:

```yaml
!Assay
seqspec_version: 0.0.0
assay: My Assay
sequencer: My Sequencer
name: MyAssay/Myseq
doi: doi-to-assay-release.org
publication_date: 01 January 1970
description: My awesome assay
modalities:
  - RNA
lib_struct: www.link-to-lib-structs.com
library_spec:
	...
```

and add information to the regions you've identified. For example, add the "onlist" for the `R1.fastq.gz` barcode:

```yaml
- !Region
  parent_id: null
  region_id: barcode
  region_type: barcode
  name: barcode
  sequence_type: onlist
  sequence: NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
  min_len: 16
  max_len: 16
  onlist:
    filename: onlist_barcode.txt
    md5: 131d3e81f7070402fa972d320f88449b
  regions: null
```

## Format and check the spec

Update the `seqspec` file with `seqspec format`:

```bash
seqspec format -o fmt.yaml spec.yaml
```

And lastly, check that the spec is properly formatted and manually correct errors as needed:

```bash
seqspec check fmt.yaml
```

## View the spec

To view the "ordered tree" representation of the `seqspec`, run

```bash
seqspec print fmt.yaml
```

which prints

```bash
                                             ┌─'barcode:16'
                              ┌─R1.fastq.gz──┤
                              │              └─'umi:12'
────────────── ──rna──────────┤
                              ├─R2.fastq.gz─ ──'cDNA:150'
                              └─I1.fastq.gz─ ──'index7:8'
```

# A note on checking the correctness of the spec

The `seqspec` CLI comes with the capabilities to check the correctness of your `spec.yaml` against the formal specification. When running `seqspec check spec.yaml` you may find that your spec has numerous errors that will need to be corrected. The following are the kinds of errors you may encounter:

```bash
# The "assay" value was not specified in the spec
[error 1] None is not of type 'string' in spec['assay']

# The "modalities" are not using the controlled vocabulary
[error 2] 'Ribonucleic acid' is not one of ['rna', 'tag', 'protein', 'atac', 'crispr'] in spec['modalities'][0]

# The "region_type" is not using the controlled vocabulary
[error 3] 'link_1' is not one of ['atac', 'barcode', 'cdna', 'crispr', 'fastq', 'gdna', 'hic', 'illumina_p5', 'illumina_p7', 'index5', 'index7', 'linker', 'ME1', 'ME2', 'methyl', 'nextera_read1', 'nextera_read2', 'poly_A', 'poly_G', 'poly_T', 'poly_C', 'protein', 'rna', 's5', 's7', 'tag', 'truseq_read1', 'truseq_read2', 'umi'] in spec['library_spec'][0]['regions'][3]['region_type']

# The "sequence_type" is not using the controlled vocabulary
[error 4] 'linker' is not one of ['fixed', 'random', 'onlist', 'joined'] in spec['library_spec'][0]['regions'][3]['sequence_type']

# The "region_id" is not unique across the spec
[error 5] region_id 'cell_bc' is not unique across all regions

# The length of the given "sequence" is less than the "min_len" specified for the sequence
[error 6] 'sample_bc' sequence 'NNNNNNNN' length '8' is less than min_len '10'

# The "filename" for the specified "onlist" does not exist in the same location as the spec.
[error 7] i5_index_onlist.txt does not exist

# The provided "sequence" contains invalid characters (only A, C, G, T, N, and X are permitted)
[error 8] 'NNNNNNNNZN' does not match '^[ACGTNX]+$' in spec['library_spec'][0]['regions'][4]['sequence']

# The "md5" for the given "onlist" file is not a valid md5sum
[error 9] '7asddd7asd7' does not match '^[a-f0-9]{32}$' in spec['library_spec'][0]['regions'][8]['onlist']['md5']
```

`seqspec check spec.yaml` can be run again after fixing these errors to ensure that the spec fully conforms to the formal specification.
